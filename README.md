## "Sign up" project
### The problem
Recently I wanted to sign up my kid for a school event with limited number of participants. The sign up process was a kind of "first come, first served". Unfortunately by the time I heard about the event, all the places were booked.
### The solution
My idea is to create a web site where people can register for an event. It should be transparent how many spots are available and what's the due date for registration. After the due date, the application automatically and randomly chooses who got successfully signed up.
#### Example
1. Event is created with due date of 1st December 2021, 10 spots available.
2. Link to this event is distributed externally (e.g. by email).
3. People get registered for the event and wait for the due date. Let's say there are 22 people who registered and wait.
4. At the due date, the application randomly chooses among the registrants, 10 lucky ones who got signed up.
5. The result of sign up proess is avaiable on the event site.
